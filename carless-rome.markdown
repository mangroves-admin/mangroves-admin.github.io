                            <p>Millennia after its imperial apex, Rome continues to have immense visibility in the world. Here was developed, over 2,000 years ago, the very concept of a <i>transportation system</i> connecting the widest reaches of its empire with paved roads, maritime routes, navigation canals, ports, stocking and rest areas, and integrated systems for the rapid transportation of products, passengers and information.</p>

                            <p>But ever since the invention of mechanically propelled vehicles, Rome has been lagging in its ability to innovate. What was once the pinnacle of infrastructure and planning now has the worst mobility in Europe.</p>

                            <p>Its famous and vast archaeological remains buried up to a depth of 30-40 meters have so far constituted a critical obstacle to developing an effective underground transport system, at least using traditional technologies. As of now, Rome only has two completed subway lines, and a third one still under construction, all using traditional heavy trains and infrequent service.</p>

                            <p>The Strategic Plan for Urban Mobility proposes employing 100% electric and driverless people movers, small-diameter tunnels and small footprint elevators, and the digital optimization of the transportation system.</p>

                            <p>Its objective is to liberate the <b>largest pedestrianized area in the world</b> — an area of roughly 20 km<sup>2</sup> — which would include Western Europe’s largest archeological area and a cornucopia of ancient, medieval, Renaissance, baroque and modern architectural and artistic treasures dispersed throughout the living city fabric.</p>

                            <p>The project envisions the rebirth of Rome’s historic center, not as a playground for tourists, but as a <b>nodal hub for the global creative knowledge industry</b>. It aims to revive Rome as a desirable place for the creative arts, global think tanks and conferences - and daily life for its people, as it has been repeatedly over the past two millennia. Tourism will beneﬁt from improved mobility but remain secondary to the true life of the city.</p>

                                <p>The Strategic Plan for Sustainable Mobility, drafted by Antonio Tamburrino at the request of Rome's Mayor in 2012, proposes a <b>5 Ring</b> solution to Rome's transprotation challenges.</p>
                                <p>The plan calls for the <b>elimination of private motor vehicles from the city center</b>, thought not from greater Rome, where a new generation of cleaner, autonomous and shared electric vehicles will continue to serve the city's residents and visitors, thanks to improved surface and subsurface arteries (rings 1-3).</p>
                                <p>Clean mobility solutions from walking and cycling to emerging electric micromobility options benefit from (and make feasible) the vast pedestrian zone served by the Tiber Tramway and the Central Loop (rings 4-5).</p>

                            <div class="rome-column" id="rome-column-2-1-2">
                                <p>Key to implementing the Five Rings plan and in particular the Central Loop is a technical solution to the problem of <b>non-invasive tunneling</b> below the city's rich archaeological strata.</p>
                                <p>The Central Loop is conceived to weave its way at the minimum possible depth below the ruins (as little as 12 meters below the surface) through tunnels with a diameter of under five meters.</p>
                                <p>With small cars (16-25 passengers) and frequent automated service (even every 60 seconds) stations can be virtually eliminated, replaced by elevators which provide direct access to vehicles, thus reducing archeologicals impact.</p>
                                <p><b>The company which provides this solution will chart a crucial role in the next phase of Rome's evolving history.</b></p>
