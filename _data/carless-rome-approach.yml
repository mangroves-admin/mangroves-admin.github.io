title: An Approach to Carless Rome
subtitle: The Idea and Initial Questions
copy: "The force of Rome has always sprung from its transit capacities. It begins with the major  river artery, first called Rumon, akin to its city and founder alike. From the early hill tribes and their tangles around the Tiber and its reach to source and sea, to consular roads and latter-day rails erupting from the Servian and Aurelian Walls, the mobility of Rome has long been index of the city's vitality, initially brewed from the confluence of Etruscans, Greeks and Latins. 
<br><br>

Ironically, Rome's metabolic ways facilitated both outward conquest and inward crush.  When beaten down to its nadir in the 7th-century, the city was kept afloat on its own  ruins by these same conduits. Through the complex dance of Pope, King, and Emperor  from the Middle Ages on, Rome once again resurged, a jewel of the Renaissance and  Grand Tour, only then to be flattened by a burdening modern state.
<br><br>

From the 1870 unification of Italy to the era of <i>dolce vita</i> a century later, Rome became  sieged by its own new mantle as <i>Roma capitale</i>, its river choked off from the people and  squatted by ungainly government blocks. The postwar boom only swamped the traffic  with motorized rubber and unchecked growth in the periphery, with no viable public  connectivity but a skimpy metro, a lumbering tangle of bus lines, and disjected outward  access.
<br><br>

This dire dysfunction and the recent flood of mass tourism have now pressed Rome to a  new low, far behind other major global cities in vibrancy, motility, and livability. It is time for Rome to liberate itself as people and place from the scourge of long stagnation and get back on the map through fluid mobility for a greener century.

With a multimodal nexus of light rail, tunnels, loops, roads, and trams, Eng. Tamburrino proposes to <i>transmobilize</i> Rome with a fresh system of \"five rings and a string.\" Starting  with the Tiber Tramway and the river's sluicing, the plan claims to redress the city along its  natural axis, redintegrate the pulse of center and periphery, respawn the largest-yet pedestrian urban core with rhythmic motion and life. This would free the familiar streets and quarters by halving - in keeping with EU goals - the current carbon emissions and auto traffic, replacing them with a pulsing interplay of people, biota, and cultural performance. The resulting <i>urbs</i> could again, reconditioned, become an earthwide goad for creative knowledge and webbed life, nurturing to residents and visitors alike. The way in which this may happen could be a communal venture for the whole Open City for decades to come.

In our study and engagement with Antonio himself, we found much to admire, and as much to ask and probe. Certainly the stated purpose and intended results for the City were encouraging and would even extend larger urban trends and ambitions elsewhere: Singapore, Curitiba, Vienna, Kigali, Paris, Barcelona... Not being in a position to assess the strictly technical aspects of the project, we did appreciate its stated goal of slashing the car traffic and carbon emissions and creating greener social space, not to speak of the liberation of the Tiber to its own larger belt. Still, we offer several periblematic questions: "
