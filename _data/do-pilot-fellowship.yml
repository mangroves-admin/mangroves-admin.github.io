- title: Pilot Fellowship
  copy: "In October 2021, we set sail on our inaugural Pilot Fellowship in hybrid mode. With twelve around a caf√© table Durham, NC (USA) or piping in from Uganda to Utah (Italy and Canada in between), we worked weekly on the theme of \"the common and the commonable.\" Pursuing a multilingual, pluriversal approach (<i>ubuntu</i> a leitmotif) and freed from \"resources\" as the grounding of any common, we probed what it would mean to regard the whole <i>interaffective</i> web of reality beyond the tired technohuman grid. Along the way, we waded through notions of (Janian) care, festivity, pluriverse, \"transverse,\" <i>buen vivir</i>, measures of happiness, (re)migration, the biotic, placemaking, <i>arcology</i> and habitat. What's common or commonable is no longer just a question demanding answers, but also one parrying them...

  The second year, 2022-23, we worked, again hybrid, on \"growth,\" joined by remote Fellows ranging from Italy and Nigeria to India/Canada and South Africa/NY. Pushing off a conventional scientific framework (Smil), we dove into Daoist emergence and Nagarjuna's mutual co-arising (<i>pratityasamutpada</i>) via A. v. Humboldt's <i>Wechselwirkung</i> (exchange-effect), cycled through temporal processes in Qohelet and Ibn Khaldun, and sensed growth in Hildegardian and Potawatomi life. Then we got into the wilds of Moche sex pots, thermodynamics, Marxian labor-growth inversions, rhizomatic mycopunks, mutual aid hip hop, Illichian conviviality, housing/dwelling, and urban growth with its illusions. Capping the year, we had lively visits with D. da Cunha on \"ubiquitous wetness,\" A. Escobar and M. Osterweil on designing relationality, D. Richter on critical zone science, and A. Tamburrino on his Carless Rome plan. In all this, we kept prodding, poking Mangroves' own ideas of affectivity, periblem and counterdesign - protocols of seedings to come."
