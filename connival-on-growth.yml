  copy: "In 1972, the Club of Rome issued <i>The Limits to Growth</i>, a report on the state of the planet that sounded alarm about the viability of the global economy. Thirty years later, it was revised to advocate <i>degrowth</i>. Half a century later, we intend not only to review this trajectory of thought and its impact in light of current realities, but indeed to reinterrogate the very concept of growth. We will do this next year in Rome with a conference-carnival - hence <i>connival</i>, moving around the city with thinking, doing, and moving out of the econometric prison of growth. All are welcome in person or online, and a documentary will also ensue."
