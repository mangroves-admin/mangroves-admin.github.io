  copy: "Truly radical doing seethes with radical thought, and that thought speaks a new tongue. This may take midnight calm to digest. At Mangroves we think and do <i>interaffectivity</i>: the ceaseless swirl of <i>affecting and being affected</i> through diverse relations, scales, and worldings. This goes beyond interdependence or interbeing, which still accord primacy to being(s). For us, reality dances metabolic, evincing the sheer weave of <i>interaffect</i>."

- title: Problem vs. Periblem
  copy: "Since this <i>interaffecting</i> goes on everywhere, no issue or reality is self-contained  - not climate change, not bio-collapse, not inequity... The traditional problem-solution model is at best an easy fiction, at worst a crippling mirage. We chase after problems as volumetric things to be batted under control, yet they outrun us and, through their solutions, spawn new \"problems\" left unthought. So instead of the \"problem,\" we think the <i>periblem</i>: reality as ever immersive and porous all around. In place of solutions, we spur <i>inflections</i> that play with the giddy thickness of reality through many directions. This transgresses a merely human optic, much less a commercial or statist frame. So, we don't <i>solve</i> anything (so as to monetize or walk away from it), because the <i>periblem</i> never closes or stops but keeps on churning."

- title: Deep Counterdesign
  copy: "With a <i>periblematic</i> approach, we start rethinking how to engage the vast - and deeply tied - waves of life earthwide, though never as one block. While traversing various worldings, we burrow at what's already been in the long flex of time, even prehuman and pre-Earth, and what is likely to come. Then we (help) forge a theoretical framing fit to matters at hand. Amidst these deep, roaming views, we find the spinning particularities of any locale/theater where certain (meta)praxes may be seeded, prototyped, grown. Throughout, we embrace distinct cultural and geobiotic factors to respect conditions on the ground, so as to urge a synergy of local forces for common life, in turn spurring other tailored interventions translocally. In this sense we are also after a <i>sharable</i> - not imposed - <i>common</i>."
