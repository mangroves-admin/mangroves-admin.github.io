  copy: "Having plumbed \"the common\" against the anthropocentric grain in our inaugural Fellowship, we stepped into the maze-forest of \"growth\" with these curvatures: the pluriverse, the \"transverse,\" and the \"perverse\" [PURR-verse]. What, you say? While preglobal worldings have projected cosmoi of their own, a scientized neo-empire has imposed <i>its</i> universe on all others under the guise of objective, not just conventional, reality. The pluriverse ensures the continuance of distinct, even resistant, worldings. The partial connections between them permit give-and-take, yet the power dynamics also forbid fair play or real delinkage (Mignolo). The transverse is our way to slide between them and take up, not an othering of worldings, but an othering of <i>one's own</i> sufficient to negotiate \"otherly\" realities. Still, even this transversal can reify, detemporalize, indeed underpower each common lifing - or \"co-lifing\" over transoms. Enter the <i>perverse</i>. Rather than reducing to a Deist minimum (Cherbury) for a new universal, we proposed a <i>perversal</i> platform where the evolving interactions of the pluriverse and its transversals can also spawn multilaterally translated, sharable commons allowing at once evolving diverging and convergence. We mean this beyond a human focus. With this macromicro differentiality and \"posthumanist\" imaginary, we could now begin to think \"growth\" in its myriad embodiments - even inversions, eversions, reversions..."

- title: Undulations
  copy: "Stage set, we slid into V Smil's survey of \"growth.\" As a universalist account under scientific scope, it deployed a metron for all material reality: from the cell to megacities under one lens, with patterned vertical climbs: linear, logarithmic, exponential. Rimming scientific consensus, Smil warns of peaks and limits of growth. But what of incommensurate ways of describing, living the world? Can a non-lizard do the <i>sentipensar</i> for a lizard? In his monoscoping, Smil owes much to the breathtaking correlations of A von Humboldt across the continents he traversed, but also assumes the All that Humboldt globalized of Hegel's (imperializing) Hellenic universal. We asked: Can difference in kind be corralled numerically without requalification or translation? Leaving such a platform of \"growth,\" we plied our own translinguistic query. With over two dozen tongues among us, we uncovered abundant construals of \"growth\": lengthening, enlarging, stretching, opening, greening, unfurling, blowing up... Of the last, we also plied the Greek <i>physis</i> on R Williams' relook at \"nature,\" derived as it was from that Greek term but denatured by modern science.

  <p>Retaking an ampler sense of growth, we turned to the striking insights of Laozi, Nagarjuna, and Qohelet, who articulated processes in terms of radical contingency, emergence, and metabolic recursion. We saw the latter (with B Lawrence's help) in Ibn Khaldun's dynastic phases where, within each phase of civilizational growth and social cohesion, there was also degrowth or attrition, atrophy. The Chinese painting \"Up the River at Qingming\" pictorialized this complex irony: At the peak of prosperity was already decline, decadence - peril. But growth is not only socioeconomic, as we gleaned from the Rhenish Hildegard, Kimmerer's Potawatomi plains, and sex pots of the pre-Columbian Moche elite. It is also spiritual, ecological, social - in sum, relational. A Escobar and M Osterweil reminded us (in person) of the abyssal import of that awareness, as did mycopunkerie, Kropotkin's (and Wu-Tang Clan's) mutual aid, along with Illich's conviviality - a sort of mutual growth like <i>ubuntu</i>. Others pointed at useless or noxious growth (Marx, Graeber, Bregman). The relationality of growth became sobering as we considered \"operational land\" (<i>cum</i> air and sea), where cities subsist on their far-reaching command-control, and D Richter's plurimodal critical zone science. Such vantages gave us caveats to thinking through current plights of housing and dwelling, as well as a wide lens from which to approach D da Cunha's protean concept of ubiquitous wetness and A Tamburrino's Carless Rome project, an attempt to transmobilize - thus recondition - Rome.</p>"

  copy: "Having blown through the vertiginous whirlwind with \"growth\" in both theoretic and pragmatic terms, we now find ourselves in a new clearing, a calm meadow of <i>\"useless\" fruition</i>. This mirrors the useful blurring that characterized our earlier toil on \"the common,\" and points a way out of the chokehold of relentless (economic) growth and \"progress.\" Maybe with this release, growth could now be <i>renatured</i> if not rewilded, allowed to go its thousand woven ways."
