  copy: "Even as we plot the Connival on Growth, we're also putting our hands to a critico-creative play with more-than-human intelligence and its artificial modes - just as <i>they</i> explode.

Meanwhile, we will also continue to stage a number of intimate encounters on- or offline here or there. So stay tuned..."
