- title: Carless Rome
  copy: "With Rome our future home as our live laboratory, we are studying a plan by Eng. Antonio Tamburrino to transmobilize the Eternal City. Long the site of comprehensive transport, Rome has also fallen to the chokehold of automobiles and mass tourism, with all attendant degradation in ecological, economic and cultural conditions. This plan seeks to <i>revive</i> and <i>recondition</i> the city by unclogging mobility throughout, removing cars from the historic city, and connecting all parts largely through free electric people-movers. The time and space liberated can then afford new forms of life, work, habitat-building for a rich lifeweb. How viable is this plan? Follow us as we learn and think more!"
