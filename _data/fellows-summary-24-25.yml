  copy: "Just as \"technology\" has been usurped by digitized technology, so current discourse of \"intelligence\" tends to be hijacked by issues surrounding AI, in turn overshadowing and coopting even the recent flourishing of neuroscience (viz. Neuralinks). This has had a reverse, obscuring effect on larger questions of \"intelligence,\" and given unchecked agency to high tech forces."

  copy: "In this collaborative Fellowship, we will peel back that current cover, first by tracing various transcultural and -historical framings of \"intelligence,\" then examine how current anglophone constructions relate to them, and how AI as a \"sublime\" machinic computation might be resituated in this larger (set of) horizon(s) to enable critico-creative engagement with various unfoldings of \"intelligence.\" Enfolded into this protocol will be non-anthropocentric notions of intelligence, extending across species and individuated framings toward webbed and biomic notions and tellings. From there, we will ask how this variegate genealogy and morphology of \"intelligence\" might activate a new set of conceptual and ecosocial praxes not dictated by the techno-telos of AI-driven \"intelligence.\" Materials to be examined will range from Daoist and Neoconfucian, Helleno-Abrahamic, Indo-Buddhist, Mexica (Aztec) and other \"non-Axial\" or -theoretical traditions, as well as contemporary anthropology, neuroscience and new media and tech studies. Attention will also be given to the entanglement between intelligence and ethics/ethology, memory, sensoriality, and the political."
