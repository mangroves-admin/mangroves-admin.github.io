title: An Approach to Carless Rome
copy: "<span>(1)</span> If the bane of mass tourism is also a function of growing middle classes across the globe, would greater capacity of the City to move people simply be playing catch-up to the continually swelling tides of tourists? Would it not be just as important to induce folks everywhere to be more content where they are without extravagant trips or bucket lists to check off? For that matter, what might some provisions be to enable a 15-minute city for Rome's residents, so they would be able to do most of what they need and want to without having constantly to cross the city? In other words, would one form of energy saving engender an increase in new forms of energy consumption?
<br><br>

<span>(2)</span> Who would benefit most from the enhanced livability of Rome? If the historic center is already prohibitively expensive, wouldn't an improved city only augment the cost of living at the center? What would it take for <i>all</i> neighborhoods to be happier places to dwell, or would the periphery simply become the displaced parking lot for the City? What cultural and ethico-spiritual shifts would need to be afoot for Romans to dispense with cars altogether, and not just in the historic city? The buy-in cannot be assumed or remain superficial. People will need, for example, to give up driving to discount supermarkets and buying mounds of toilet paper at a time. Instead they will have to walk more often to closer shops, as in the pre-car past. How do you put that proverbial genie back in the bottle?
<br><br>

<span>(3)</span> It seems that, for a project like Antonio's to reach its own aims, it also has to galvanize a much larger sociopolitical movement and enlist wide participation in the buildout of a full cultural transformation. What do you tell all the bus and cab drivers of the present they should do instead for a living? What alternatives and incentives need to be offered? Would high tech swoop in and just colonize the city anew? In sum, Carless Rome can only succeed if the whole city dives into a vast collective experiment before, during and after all its infrastructural segments. A top-down approach will surely fail.
<br><br>

<span>(4)</span> Lastly, we had learned about the concept of operational land that always keeps visible the command-control relations between \"city\" and \"country.\" To reduce the extractive power of a city, it would be necessary for it to become more self-sufficient - even frugal -  in energy, food, material use. How does that happen? When Dilip da Cunha sat in on our discussion with Antonio, he posed the question, why do we even speak of the city at all? Isn't everything an open network? If so, it also seems that that network is also a highly graduated one in which nodes we call cities and towns require a major shift in their synaptic habits within and without.
<br><br>

Dear people, what do <i>you</i> think of all this?
