title: "Pilot Fellowship: The Setup"
copy: "A dozen people, half sipping coffee and savoring pastries in Foster Street Coffee in Durham, NC of the American South (part of Turtle Island), half strewn over the continents, gathered around a common hearth of <i>sentipensar</i>, or thinking-feeling (A Escobar). Each year has a theme, but it's not a discrete topic. We poke around and through it, aware that, like most things, it is full of negative or empty space, and can take protean forms. The group is colorful; everyone bears a different discipline, line of activity, complexion, itinerary - aged 20 to 60+. We transgress the academic-lay divide, and are stronger for it. Each week we read, hear, see something, and then come together for 2+ hrs. to toil and play with it. At first, David leads the workshops to set the tone, but soon folx start taking turns moderating or engaging guest discussants. We start with a little personal writing or meditation, then discuss, draw, pause, dissent, and laugh. We record each meeting so anyone can review it. English is <i>lingua franca</i>, but all are invited to think in any language, and broaden, bend our thinking and act with it. The materials are not preset from a syllabus; they emerge as we work, and take their own path and contour. We hold out no deliverable, but move from guiding concepts to exercises of counterdesign. What we discover is that we become what we explore: the common, growth, and so on. We don't jump out of the year ready-made bodhisattvas - just nudged into the long processâ€¦"
