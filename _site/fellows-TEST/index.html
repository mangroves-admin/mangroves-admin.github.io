                            <p>Truly radical doing seethes with radical thought, and that thought speaks a new tongue. This may take calm patience to digest. At Mangroves we think and do <i>interaffectivity</i>: the ceaseless swirl of <i>affecting and being affected</i> through diverse relations, scales, and worldings. This goes beyond interdependence or interbeing, which still accords primacy to being(s). For us, reality is a persistent dance of the metabolic, evincing the sheer weave of <i>interaffect</i>.</p>

                            <p>Since this <i>interaffecting</i> goes on everywhere, no issue is self-contained. The traditional problem-solution model is at best an easy fiction, at worst (and certain scales) a crippling mirage. We chase after problems as if things volumetric to be batted under control, when they always outrun us and, together with their solutions, spawn new "problems" left unthought. So instead of the "problem," we think the <i>periblem</i>: reality as ever immersive and porous all around. In place of solutions, we spur <i>inflections</i> that play with the giddy thickness of reality from/in many directions. This transgresses a merely human optic, much less a commercial or statist frame. So, we don't <i>solve</i> anything (so as to walk away from it), because the <i>periblem</i> never closes or stops but keeps on churning.</p>

                            <p>With a <i>periblematic</i> approach, we start rethinking how to engage the vast - and deeply tied - waves of life earthwide. We burrow at what's already been in the long flex of time, even prehuman and pre-Earth, and what is likely to come, while traversing varying worldings. Then we (help) forge a theoretical framing fit to matters at hand. Amidst these deep, roaming views, we find the spinning particularities of any locale/theater where certain (meta)praxes may be seeded, prototyped, grown. Throughout, we embrace distinct cultural and geobiotic factors to respect conditions on the ground, so as to urge a synergy of local forces for common life, in turn spurring other tailored interventions translocally. In this sense we are also after a <i>sharable</i> - not imposed - <i>common</i>.</p>

With twelve around a café table Durham, NC (USA) or piping in from Uganda to Utah (Italy and Canada in between), we worked weekly on the theme of "the common and the commonable." Pursuing a multilingual, pluriversal approach (<i>ubuntu</i> a leitmotif) and freed from "resources" as the grounding of any common, we probed what it would mean to regard the whole <i>interaffective</i> web of reality beyond the tired technohuman grid. Along the way, we waded through notions of (Janian) care, festivity, pluriverse, "transverse," <i>buen vivir</i>, GNHI, (re)migration, the biotic, placemaking, <i>arcology</i> and habitat. What's common or commonable is no longer just a question demanding answers, but also one parrying them... <br /> <br /> The second year, 2022-23, we worked, again hybrid, on "growth," joined by remote Fellows ranging from Italy and Nigeria to India/Canada and South Africa/NY. Pushing off a conventional scientific framework (Smil), we dove into Daoist emergence and Nagarjuna's mutual co-arising (<i>pratityasamutpada</i>) via A. v. Humboldt's <i>Wechselwirkung</i> (exchange-effect), cycled through temporal processes in Qohelet and Ibn Khaldun, and sensed growth in Hildegard and Potawatomi life. Then we got into the wilds of Moche sex pots, thermodynamics, Marxian labor-growth inversions, rhizomatic mycopunks, hip hop as mutual aid, Illichian conviviality, housing/dwelling, city growth and its illusions. Capping the year, we had lively visits with D. da Cunha on "ubiquitous wetness," A. Escobar and M. Osterweil on designing relationality, D. Richter on critical zone science, and A. Tamburrino on his Carless Rome plan. In all this, we kept prodding, poking Mangroves' own ideas of affectivity, periblem and counterdesign - protocols of seedings to come.</p>

                            <p>With Rome our desired haunt as live laboratory, we have also been g(r)azing at a plan by Eng. Antonio Tamburrino to transmobilize the whopping Eternal City. Though a hub of comprehensive transport since Antiquity, Rome is now victim to the twin choke of cars and mass tourism, with dispiriting slides in eco/nomic and cultural vibes. This plan aims to revive, recast the <i>Urbs</i> by unclogging mobility throughout, removing rubber traffic from the historic city, and connecting all parts with foot motion and free electric people-movers. The time-space saved could then afford new forms of life, work, and habitat-making for a richer lifeweb. Is this scheme well conceived or viable? What is it likely - risking - to generate? Is it ignoring or suppressing something? Follow us as we learn and think more!</p>

Half a century later, even as the Club has itself felt a muffled response to its own Cassandra cries, we intend to re-ask: What does growth <i>mean</i> beyond its usual Anglophone, economic patois? We intend to do this between late 2024 and early 2025 in Rome with a conference-carnival (= <i>Connival</i>), roving <i>per urbem</i> with thinking-doing, and plotting escape from the econometric prism/prison of growth.
