name: PilotFellowship
copy: "Aim: To continue prototyping the working model begun by last year's inaugural
  Mangroves Pilot Fellowship, an experiment in deep, stereoscopic, and transversal
  collaboration on lifeweb metadesigns.
  Contour: 12 invited fellows meet with Mangroves Instigator David Liu for 24 weekly
  sessions of study and good troubling on notions of \"growth,\" with an eye toward
  fresh metadesigns.
  Theme: Contemporary discourse of \"growth\" tends to be held by a duopoly of
  biology and economics, with industrialized agriculture caught in the middle - and
  always vertically charted. This year's Fellowship will begin by interrogating these
  sedimentations of thought and speech, using Vaclav Smil's Growth as a point de
  d√©part, limning the work of the Club of Rome on economic (de)growth, and from
  there begin a search for alternative conceptions of growth beyond Anglophone
  impositions, verticality, and techno-scientific determinations. In our attempts at new
  thinking and design, we will also take leave of much-vaunted model of \"human
  flourishing\" now in vogue.
  Format: Half of the fellows will be local to the Durham area, and the other half
  dispersed around Earth. The time will be Fridays, 10 am to 12 pm ET US. The in-person
  group will in person in Durham, joined online by others from their respective
  locations. Occasionally, off-site visits and meetings may also be held. These would
  also be linked to corresponding members by video.
  Activity: We will read on or around the theme from many directions/framings,
  generating various understandings and ideas, and cogenerate and seed new
  (meta)praxes suitable for the locality with sharable contours or analogies for other
  places and framings. In Mangroves lingo, we call it deep counterdesign.
  Group composition: For variegation of expressivity and capacity, the cohort will
  consist of persons of contrasting and intersecting cultural/linguistic backgrounds,
  orientations, locations, activities, framings and associations.
  Compensation: There is a stipend of $2500, contingent on full attendance and
  participation, payable in two equal sums after each half of sessions."
