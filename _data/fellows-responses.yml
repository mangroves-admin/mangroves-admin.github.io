  copy: "Compared with my pre-Mangroves self, I conceive human society more as a lovely artifact, correctly material and consequently malleable.... I think I better appreciate the continuity of natural and artificial growth and making. Thanks to our fellowship, I keep wanting to apply extended ecological imaginings."

  copy: "I have learned to interrogate the root of words as a means to show their non universal meaning… Above perhaps any other single \"concept\", \"relationality\" is the one that has most impacted my understanding and approach to everything else. I have throughout  the year found myself thinking about topics in my learning and teaching through the lens  of their meaning as acquired from their relational subject/object. The philosophical  readings from the beginning of the year were excellent starting points for me to see things this way because they highlighted how across different cultures, time-periods, geographies, etc, one fundamental (if we might) aspect of life-processes is the movement between thoughts, beings, designs, realities, etc. Because of this philosophical foundation it both became more 'legitimate' to then move onto  contemporary issues, but also served as a most important frame of reference."

  copy: "The Mangroves environment, so rich in diverse experiences and interests, has also, I think, offered me emotional and psychological growth. I have verified in these months on myself a development of emotional intelligence, self-awareness, empathy and interpersonal skills. Another thing Mangroves taught me is that adopting an inter- and transdisciplinary approach allows for the recognition of the interconnectedness and complexity of growth, highlighting the need to collaborate and integrate knowledge in various fields to promote comprehensive and sustainable development, overcoming with a periblematic approach the problem-solution habitus that characterizes our age."

  copy: "The more one embraces commonality in an individualistic context, the more uncommon one becomes by virtue of gaining insights into matters unengaged by the milieu."

- name: Adriana, '21
  copy: "During the months of this fellowship, I've thought many times about what constitutes a \"common\". My instinct initially was to see the commons in a purely materialist sense; the land, the resources, the ecosystems, etc. Working in parallel on my master's thesis and this fellowship made me realize the importance of our \"imaginary commons\", such as our founding myths and stories… In every interaction, every presentation, every project that tries to make an impact on the world, I will now ask: what story is this trying to tell me? What meaning does it try to convey and which underlying assumptions does it make use of? I will also consider whether or not such a piece of storytelling is creating a new common where actors (human and non-human) can connect and interact as equals, and whether this will serve our future common good."

  copy: "This experience has encouraged me to lend my voice and experience to future groups/  assemblages intent on posing complex questions and working out collaborative responses in innovative ways… not necessarily toward a specific end point."

  copy: "We must understand that we all have points of entry into conversations based on our personal experiences and knowledge. Therefore, the Mangroves Fellowship encourages everyone to participate and share their thoughts."
