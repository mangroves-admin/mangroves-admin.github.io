- title: Basal Thought
  copy: "Weber's <i>Freischütz</i> Overture. The conductor: a rakish Carlos Kleiber. He taps in the orchestra on a <i>pp</i> - and stops it right away. No so forward, he warns his men (year 1970) - come in after everybody else. Nonsense - but it works exactly as allowed, uncannily emergent: <i>e nihilo omnia</i>. 
  <br><br>

  It's this sheer contingency of things that piques - and illuminates - our basal thought. Such thinking is both a navigational vessel and its own flight. It is itself coemergent, and can be self-navigated in a Möbius way.

  If affect = affecting + being affected, then reality may thus be glimpsed: Affect affects affect, where the noun verbs its own becoming. Affect < <i>affectus</i>, at once singular and plural. Being/s, knowing, happening, any change or constancy, are affect; so are energy, matter, their antitheses, information, ∆, spacetime, at any scale or intensity, in whatever direction(s) or framing. Everything is a differential, metabolic play of affect through the virtual, actual, hidden/absent - in sum, <i>interaffect</i>.
  <br><br>
 
  Of consequence, systems, as complex interaffects, are <i>illusionments</i>, affects playing together. Internet and tech convergence, biomes, galaxies, cultures - even simple cells and atoms, are illusionments. They can come into visibility or consistence or not - either being an affect. Everything can be dis/affected, undone, thus also dis/illusioned, but that is not the end of affect - only its reaffecting.
  <br><br>
 
  History or narrative, at any scale, is also a series or web of illusionments, as are its <i>Zeitgeiste</i>, material sub- or superstructures. As singular-plural affects, we live in perpetual dis/illusionment, and can affect (change or make up) things (affects) in relation to all other affectivity. So can other affects - together playing out the grand <i>commeatus</i> (trafficking) that is throbbing reality."
