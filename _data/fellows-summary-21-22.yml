- title: "2021-22: The Common and the Commonable"
- copy: "Mangroves launched its Pilot Fellowship with the theme \"the Common and the Commonable.\" The notion of the common might at first recall something mundane, resourceable, exploitable - public. The commonable: rocky grass fields or animals grazing with bent necks on sharable land. Both are oft  reduced to some objectified commons. Our path was to egress from this legacy and ask: What might the common and commonable signify when freed from such contexts?


  <p>Our fearless cohort unwound these terms by imagining the common as a webbing of encounters: dealings of any kind between forms or processes, worldviews and ideologies, and stories and methodologies. Here the common is as manifest in the gut biome of a cow as it is in the heat of political negotiation, in caves, around creek and the rock, as it is in spirit - none of which need be a common <i>for us</i>. So, we  faced our first quandary: where the common ends and the uncommon begins.</p>

  <p>It then became necessary to sniff out where the common has faced erasure due to hierarchical assignations, particularly those pitting knowledges and worldings against each other in such a way that the uncommon emerges a violent force. There, the common can also emerge a force of erasure, mushing difference into a purée of the \"universal.\" </p>

  <p>We looked to Arturo Escobar's weaving of the \"pluriverse\" as an alternative framing of knowledge to the tyrannical centrifuge of global development. Going on from Escobar's own flight from the universal, we began to seek not only the cohabitation of multiform truths and lifeways, but also how they can dance with each other - and allow traversal between them. We read origin stories from around the world, asking what is common and uncommon in and between them, and how those dis/junctions are born of the biomic commons such stories poke out of.</p>

  <p>Keeping taut the tension between the common and commonable, the cohort swung through disciplines and scales, feeling shared ideas morph and lose their (re)cognizability. We looked to American cities and the work of Jane Jacobs, to the uncommon in our own spirits through Gloria Anzaldua's writing, to biodiversity and human positions in it, and to life- and spiritways, art, and ideas of the good life. Without reaching explicit ends or points of production, the Fellowship steadily  became a practice of making a common of itself. Fellows, each with peculiar perspectives shaped by history, legacy, place, and self, met the others in uncommon commonness, practicing the art of mutual creation, agreement, disagreement, and listening. This became a touchstone to imagining other uncommon commons - even beyond human worldings.</p>

  <p> In the second half of our meetings, we were lucky to welcome guest discussants on community fisheries (C Klein), migration (R Bendezú), bioconservation (S Pimm), Islamicate Cosmopolitanism (B Lawrence), arcology (L McCullough), and to honor the specific skills brought by Fellows through the co-creation of our curriculum and the release of central leadership. This led us to points inconceivable at the start of the year, including collective musical improv held over Zoom, musings over broken rules and physics, multilinguistic exercises, and ever emergent and unexpected writing. Gradually, focus shifted to the question of how Fellows might seed the co-generation and cultivation of commoning practices tailored to local contexts, where the players also extend beyond humans. In the end, we both hoped to keep exploring such a process beyond our year together, and to see the year's work continue in future cohorts and projects with the inklings that keep blinking.</p>"
