- title: Deep Counterdesign
  copy: "\"Design nothing!\" screamed Enzo Mari, the Italian maker who insisted on access for all to the production of useful forms. Implicit in his call is a firm commitment to equity across classes at a time when sleek mid-century design was also projecting an elitist privilege. In the vice grip twixt the homogenization and hyper-niching of Late Capital, we face the same trap still: design something sophisticated for higher-end consumption, or dispense with user agency altogether. As to wellbeing, it's either an act of insulation or callously abandoned to mass blight.
  <br><br>

  Mangroves rejects this dichotomy. In displacing the problem-solution <i>habitus</i> of our age with an <i>inflective periblematics</i>, we enlist deep study and thought, stepping into the length and breadth of things - wetness, movement, conflict or whatever, moving around their current patterns through many tellings and eyes. Out of such variegation we discern threads of commonality, intersection or overlap - and uncommonable specificities. In this way, history and theory dance with data and speculation, facts with intuition, and critique with creation. It is in such a staging of things that <i>happy mutation</i> emerges.
  <br><br>

  From what does such mutation diverge? It threads a path out of the overwhelming violence and inertia of the technosphere, that juggernaut of growth and accumulation at the cost of all, where even extreme prerogative and power are deceived. Agency no longer stagnates at the apices of the money/power matrix but sees exertion unchained and a-teeming. In beginning to descaffold the conjuncture of neoliberal hyper-accumulation and ecological collapse - indeed deinventing the \"resource,\" this new design, de-scripting rather than prescriptive, also begins to decenter humans and their devisings from the driving train of planetary becoming. Sovereignty is withdrawn from a few mega points to be tended across the nexus of the deep ecological horizon.

  This morphs the process called design into one in which the center <i>can</i> be anywhere, and circumference nowhere. In practice, it invites and engages more-than-human communities in translocal networks from the ground up, soil to sky. The design interlaces <i>coactancy</i> wherever thinkable and is embedded  with the awareness that the process will evolve with successive modulations in dancing with emergent needs and conditions."
