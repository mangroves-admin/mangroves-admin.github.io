- name: Ishaan Aggarwal - North Goa, India
  background: ../design/img/bio-headshots/ishaan-aggarwal.jpg
  bio: "Ishaan is a systems-thinking ecologist interested in the poetics and politics of kinship. Crafting meaning in the inbetweenness and straddling distinct worlds have been occupational hazards. He sees social experimentation, playing with risky propositions, and an attunement with the more-than-human world as critical features of his evolving creaturely presence on this planet. While navigating anthropy, Ishaan regulates himself by staring at ceilings and peering into the skies in wonder, smelling foods and textures, and making malfunctioning, old, withering belongings still feel alive."


- name: Aminah Al-Attas Bradford - Durham, NC USA
  background: ../design/img/bio-headshots/aminah-al-attas-bradford.jpg
  bio: "Aminah describes herself as a Yemeni-American theologian living in an ecology lab, plying the interplay of microbes, humans, religion and the divine. One of theology's grounding convictions, that humans do not exist without God, is sometimes forgotten—but the idea that we don't exist without microbes, has scarcely been thought. To chart new paths, Aminah directs the Symbiotic Theology Project as it rewrites theology in light of humanity's holobiont nature, researches and writes for the Planetary Microbiome Stewardship Project, contributes to NC State's Dunn Lab, and collaborates as a fellow at the Berggruen Institute. She also keeps the home fires burning."

  background: ../design/img/bio-headshots/charlotte-pollet.jpg
  bio: "Charlotte is a French-naturalized Taiwanese academic. Since childhood, she has always been navigating between landscapes, social milieux, cultures, languages, academic disciplines. Eventually it landed her at the crossroads of philosophy, mathematics, Sanskrit and Chinese philology, where she has lost any sense of East and West. She felt less lost when her work in developing philosophy education for children and in the history of mathematics in Asia received recognitions."

For 16 years, he did this by building and transforming international NGOs with projects in 20+ countries and now does it through private sector entrepreneurship and advising. If money were no object (and he is currently considering the merits of transplanting free market capitalism with a gift economy), he would be a full-time healer, musician/poet/storyteller, co-farmer with his wife and friends, and foster communities with Mangrovian-esque values and practices while writing books about it with a team."
